I'm a Llama again!!!
so, this one. First time I have found Ghidra to explain the issue better than the online editor. The login function clearly allocates 16 characters for the password, but reads 48 bytes into it.
I did various testing to find the "smart" answer to this, Just repeating the return address i want over and over for the full 0x30 bytes I have to the unlock_door function, it eventually just returns to unlock door, we don't care if the rest of the stack is corrupted, as the return address is all we need.
The only thing to account for would be if any operations use a single byte value off the stack, as the injection buffer relies on it being aligned to the byte. I tried anyway and was prepared to swap the bytes if needed, but the alignement was fine.
